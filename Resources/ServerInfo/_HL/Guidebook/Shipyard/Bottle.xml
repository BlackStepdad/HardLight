  "The Bottle is a cheap and cheerful atmospheric harvester, a joint effort between Harrington Research and the Jell Design Bureau to break into the colonial market. Surprisingly speedy and maneuverable, this ship is made to quickly respond to spacing incidents and repressurize vessels once they're sealed and supply rarer gases to scientific endeavors in remote areas."
